Test Plan:

# Browsers and operating systems the tests will be run on.
 - Test will run on Windows 10 operating systems

# Next, a list of test cases should be created that match the requirements of the test suite. The test cases should include verifying the page title,
taking screenshots, maximizing the browser window, logging in and out, filling in forms, and purchasing the basic package.

1.  Verify Page Title:

Use Selenium to open the URL https://www.ultimateqa.com/automation/ and get the title of the page.
Compare the actual title with the expected title "Automation Practice - Ultimate QA".
If the actual title matches the expected title, then the test case passes. Otherwise, it fails.
